<h3 class="legal-content-sub-header second-lvl">What is Tell HTC (Experience Log)?</h3>

<p>Tell HTC (Experience Log) is software that runs in the background on your HTC phone, tablet or device (your "Device") that allows HTC Corporation and its affiliates ("HTC") to collect specific data from your Device about how you use your Device ("Usage Data" as described in further detail at "What data does HTC want to collect from your Device?" below).  Tell HTC does not collect data that is intended to identify you personally and HTC will not use any information collected by Tell HTC to attempt to identify you personally.</p>

<h3 class="legal-content-sub-header second-lvl">What does this Privacy Statement cover?</h3>

<p>This Statement covers the collection and use of Usage Data.  Other versions of Tell HTC (Experience Log) available on other HTC products will be covered by different Usage and Privacy Policies.</p>  

<p>Reference to "use" of data covers its use, storage, transmission, transfer, processing and disclosure.  This Statement does not apply to any other HTC products, features, applications or services, or those provided by third parties.</p>

<h3 class="legal-content-sub-header second-lvl">Customers under the age of majority</h3>

<p><strong>HTC does not wish to collect any data from anyone under the age of 13.  If you are under the age of 13 you should press the Decline button at the bottom of the screen </strong> on which this Statement appears, indicating that you do <stong>NOT</strong> consent to HTC collecting and using the data being requested by HTC in this Statement via Tell HTC (Experience Log).</p>

<p>If you are 13 years of age or older but under the age of majority according to local law (18 in most countries), before you decide whether or not to agree to share data from your Device about how you use your Device, you should review this Statement with your parent or guardian to make sure that you and your parent or guardian understand it.  Parents or guardians are advised to supervise their children while using the Internet, mobile and other devices.</p> 

<h3 class="legal-content-sub-header second-lvl">Why does HTC want to collect Usage Data?</h3>

<p>HTC would like to collect Usage Data so that HTC can develop improved versions of its features, functions, products and services based on the way you and other users use them, to make them easier and more intuitive to use.  For example, when all the applications downloaded to HTC phones, tablets and devices have been aggregated together, HTC can determine the popularity of different applications and this information may be utilised in subsequent HTC features, functions, products and services.  Furthermore, HTC can use Usage Data for statistical research purposes and to analyse how your Device functions.</p>

<p>Usage Data collected through Tell HTC may be combined with other data collected by HTC.</p>

<p>You grant HTC a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, transferable and perpetual licence to collect, store and use text and other data collected from your Device via Tell HTC (Experience Log) as described in this Statement.</p>

<p>HTC will not, unless required for the purpose of performing a service obligation on our part or as required or permitted by applicable law, use Usage Data other than for the reasons set out in this Statement, without your prior and express consent.</p>


<h3 class="legal-content-sub-header second-lvl">Will there be a cost to you of HTC collecting Usage Data from your Device?</h3>
<p>The default setting for data transmission on your Device is "Wi-Fi only" and on this setting data will only be transmitted when a Wi-Fi connection is available.  The HTC collecting service will seek to instigate the transmission of data from your Device and data will be transmitted if there is an available Wi-Fi connection.  If there is not a Wi-Fi connection data will not be transmitted.</p>

<p>However, you can change the data transmission setting on your Device so that your Device transmits data by either a Wi-Fi connection or over an available cellular network (such as GSM or UMTS). If you change the setting for data transmission from "Wi-Fi only" to "All data connection" you will receive a warning message that you may be charged a fee for the transmission of data over an available cellular network.  The HTC collecting service will seek to instigate the transmission of data from your Device and data will be transmitted if there is a data connection (either Wi-Fi or cellular network).  Subject to the terms of your data plan or contract with your mobile network operator in your "home country" (which is the country where you have entered into a contract with a mobile network operator and been provided with a "local" telephone number), while a small proportion of any data allowance you have or have purchased will be used in the transmission of the collected data (if you do not have a Wi-Fi connection), the directly attributable cost to you will depend on the contract you have with your mobile network operator or your Wi-Fi connection provider.  The amount of data transmitted may vary depending on the data plan or contract you have with your mobile network operator or your Wi-Fi connection provider. HTC is not responsible for the charges that your mobile network operator or Wi-Fi connection provider may apply to the transmission of data by Tell HTC (Experience Log), therefore to avoid mobile data charges use the "Wi-Fi only" setting.  There may also be charges applicable to the use of third party Wi-Fi connections.</p>

<p>No data will be transmitted when you are in any country other than your "home country" (data transfer will automatically be suspended when data roaming is detected).  The collected data will be sent only when you have a data connection (a Wi-Fi connection, or are connected to a cellular network) in your "home country".</p>

</ul>

<h3 class="legal-content-sub-header second-lvl">How does HTC collect the Usage Data?</h3>
<p>The way you use your Device and the actions you take are recorded, encrypted and stored locally on your Device. Your Device will transmit the collected data by a secured channel (HTTPS) from your Device to HTC.  When the data is transmitted it will be linked to a unique identification number which is the result of a one-way encryption.  This unique identification number will not identify which Device the data comes from, but will link all the data that is transmitted from a specific Device.  

<h3 class="legal-content-sub-header second-lvl">How often will HTC collect Usage Data from your Device?</h3>
<p>HTC will collect data automatically from your Device, approximately once every 24 hours, but may collect data more or less frequently.  You should not notice that data is being collected from your Device and the data collection should not have a significant effect on the battery life of your Device.  

<h3 class="legal-content-sub-header second-lvl">Where is the Usage Data collected by HTC stored and used?</h3>
<p>The data collected may be stored and used in the United States, Taiwan, the Netherlands, Singapore and any other country in which HTC or its service providers maintain facilities.  If the data is in certain jurisdictions, it may be accessed by local courts, law enforcement and/or national security authorities.  By accepting this Statement you give consent to the transfer of data collected by HTC to jurisdictions that may not by law give the same level of protection to such data as may be given to such data in your own jurisdiction.

<h3 class="legal-content-sub-header second-lvl">How long will HTC store the Usage Data it collects?</h3>
<p>HTC will aggregate the data it collects within one year of its collection.  During the aggregation process the data will be disassociated from the unique identification number that was given to it when it was first collected from your Device. The original data is deleted by HTC as a consequence of this aggregation process. 

<h3 class="legal-content-sub-header second-lvl">Disclosure of the Usage Data</h3>
<p>HTC does not, except as provided in this Statement or otherwise as permitted by law, disclose the data collected from your Device to third parties (other than HTC affiliate entities) without your consent.  HTC may disclose such data to third parties with which HTC has contracted for the third party to provide a service to HTC (for example, HTC leases servers from AT&T) or to other third party service providers that provide services to you that you have explicitly requested from such third party service provider. HTC may also disclose such data as part of a corporate business transaction, such as a merger or acquisition, joint venture, corporate reorganization, financing arrangement, or sale of company assets (including for due diligence purposes for a proposed business transaction).  HTC may also disclose such data in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which the data could be transferred to third parties as one of the business assets in the transaction.  HTC may share aggregated data with its telecommunication operators.</p>  

<h3 class="legal-content-sub-header second-lvl">The security of your data</h3>
<p>HTC wants to keep your data safe and uses a variety of security technologies and administrative procedures to help protect the data from unauthorised access and use. Once the data is received by HTC it is stored on a secured and reliable network, the servers are located in controlled facilities with limited access and access to the data is restricted to authorised HTC employees who need to use the data. </p>

<h3 class="legal-content-sub-header second-lvl">How to provide or withdraw your consent to HTC collecting and using the data</h3>
<p><strong><u>You can provide or withdraw your consent to HTC collecting and using the data at any time</u></strong>. Go to the Settings menu and select "About Phone", then select "Tell HTC" and check or uncheck the check box (tick box) as required: (Menu->Settings->About Phone->Tell HTC).</p>
